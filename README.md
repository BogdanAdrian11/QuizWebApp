# QuizWebApp

An application made for my final project at Fortech Java Pre-Employement Training.
It's a web application for taking quizzes and tests.

I built a Maven Spring Boot Project and used Spring Web, Spring Data and Hibernate as some of my dependencies. 
I created my database in MySQL and used Jsp for the views.
